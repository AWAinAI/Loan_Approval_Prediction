About Dataset

● The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution.

● It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status.

● This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.
